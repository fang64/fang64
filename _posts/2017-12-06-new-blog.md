We are going to have another go at it, at least with blogging again. I hope to at least remain interesting on the front of being able to keep some flow of content over the course of multiple months. I do not believe I can maintain a pace of weekly/monthly content but I can at least do thought out blog posts. I did dwell on porting my old content from wordpress to this blog, although not entirely sure if it is really worth while. 

Stay Tuned.
